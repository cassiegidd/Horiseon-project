# Horiseon-Project

## Description

This web page intends to connect the experts at Horiseon with people who want an improved prescence online and in social media settings. 
It is important to go above and beyond all accesibility standards so that the webpage can be a resource for those with disabilities and restrictions.
The existing code was missing required accesibility tools. We added attributes to be compatible with screen readers as an important step to be inclusive to those with sight restrictions. 
There were also changes made to the semantics and organization of the code as to improve readability for developers.
In accepting this challange I was able to work toward my own mastery of HTML and CSS code. I was able to improve my ability to detect redundant or less efficient code and also improve my capacity to execute code in a more organized and structured way. It also gave me the opportunity to educate myself on the restrictions of webpages and the extent to which they can be modified to accomodate every one who may need access to them. 

## Usage
This webpage can be used as a resource to connect those who need help with their on-line presence with the professionals at Horiseon who have the expertise and knowledge to assist.
The user can use links at the top of the webpage to navigate to whatever content is most applicable to them.
